\begin{abstract}
Many inference problems in the natural sciences contain \emph{labeling
  degeneracies}:
A model contains some catalog of objects (exoplanets or gravitational
chirps or neuron firings), and the model is invariant to reordering or
re-labeling those objects in the catalog.
This forces the investigator \emph{either} to force a deterministic
ordering---which leads to informative, sharp edges in the prior---or else
directly face a combinatorically large degeneracy in the likelihood
function.
Nonetheless, there are claims in the literature of converged MCMC
samplings and accurate Bayesian evidence integral or fully
marginalized likelihood (FML) calculations, for non-trivial problems
of this type.
Here we present a large family of toy problems that suffer from the
labeling degeneracy but which can be sampled exactly (that is, with
autocorrelation time of unity and without MCMC) and which have
analytic marginalizations (including the FML).
HOGG: We do SOMETHING and find SOMETHING.
It is worthy of note that our toy problem is in general far simpler
than most real inference problems that contain labeling degeneracies.
